# Experimental Configlets

Very rudimentary examples not tested as part of our QA process.  Modifying to your environment and testing the payloads absolutely necessary.

For more detailed information refer to [Configlet READ.md](../README.md)


# Experimental Examples
Configlet examples in `configlets-payloads` and `property-sets-payloads` are in JSON format. 

Configlets that affect numbered interfaces (native_vlan.json) or existing routing process IDs (static_routes.json) must be edited to match the device details of your environment.  Otherwise, they will not work properly.

> **NOTES**:
> 1. Passwords and other secret keys are not encrypted in Configlets.
> 2. You can use the same Configlets across the entire enterprise, but itâ€™s a good idea to create regionally specific Property Sets.
> 3. Avoid using shortened versions of commands.

# How to use
1. Customize the JSON files to meet your specific deployment
2. Test Configlet templates and negation templates on a separate dedicated device.
3. Create the new configlet via `POST` to AOS API 
```
/api/design/configlets
```
4. Optionnaly, create the new property-sets via `POST` to AOS API 
```
/api/property-sets
```
